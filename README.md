## Overview

This study uses an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach to simulate how interpersonal political discussions and selective exposure to media interact to shape **affective polarization**, **social diversity**, and **media diversity** within a hostile partisan environment. The model explores four communication scenarios: minimal, strong, social-dominant, and media-dominant, across 16 parameter combinations, calibrated with U.S. survey data.

## Model implementation

The model was developed in **NetLogo 6.4.0** and simulates interactions between two types of agents:

- **Human agents** with ideological positions, party ID, affective polarization, and behavioral rules for news consumption and discussion
- **Media agents** with ideological positions and influence weights

Key mechanisms include:
- Selective exposure and homophily in partner/media choice
- Ideological updating with potential **backfire effects**
- Affective polarization dynamics
- Mobility driven by satisfaction and ideological discomfort

See `Appendix.pdf` for full technical specifications and parameter settings.

## Model introduction

1. **Run the model**:
   - Open `simulation_model.nlogo` or `validation_model.nlogo` (along with thein NetLogo 6.4.0
   - Use the included **BehaviorSpace** configuration to simulate the four scenarios with all parameter combinations

2. **Visualize results**:
   - Run `visualization.R` to generate key figures:
     - Affective polarization over time
     - Social diversity and media diversity indices
     - Partisan comparisons at simulation end
